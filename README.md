# Within-population sperm competition intensity does not predict asymmetry in conpopulation sperm precedence

## Introduction  
This repository contains information to perform anaylses for Garlovsky, M. D., Leeban H. Yusuf, Michael G. Ritchie and Rhonda R. Snook. "Within-population sperm competition intensity does not predict conpopulation sperm precedence". Supplementary analyses, figures and tables can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinGarlovsky/conpopulation-sperm-precedence/blob/master/CpSP_supplementary_material.pdf).

## Demographic modelling
Demographic modelling was performed using poolseq [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA312336) from [Parker et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy147). Scripts to perform analyses can be found [here](https://github.com/LeebanY/D.montana_PoolSeq_DemoHistory).

## Postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation and proxies of sperm competition intensity.
An R project containing all data and scripts to perform analyses can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinGarlovsky/conpopulation-sperm-precedence/blob/master/Garlovsky_et.al.2020.zip). Data has also been deposited on [Dryad](link).
